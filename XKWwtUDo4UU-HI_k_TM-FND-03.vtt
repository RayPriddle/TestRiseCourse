<v ->If you ask a boss or co-worker</v>

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.410
how their week has been,

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.150
it's not surprising to get some version of this response.

4
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.410
Busy. Big ambitions create big to do lists,

5
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.110
and sometimes we misguidedly sacrifice our sanity

6
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.890
and personal schedules in the name of career success.

7
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.180
But what if it didn't have to be this way?

8
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.110
What if, you could accomplish your professional goals

9
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.120
in less time and with more breaks?

10
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.680
Here are seven time management tips

11
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.090
that can turn this fantasy into reality.

12
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.500
Use these tips to stop being busy

13
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.853
and start being productive at work.

14
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.370
The first tip is to set daily and weekly goals.

15
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.650
In other words, create a plan.

16
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.350
What do you need to accomplish by the end of the week?

17
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.320
And what do you have to do each day

18
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.130
to make that happen?

19
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.360
Commit to your weekly and daily goals

20
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.580
by making sure they're realistic.

21
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.513
It's easy to focus on just a few goals per week or per day.

22
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.980
Setting daily and weekly goals

23
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.130
can help you establish priorities,

24
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.640
determine what's essential,

25
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.830
and then plan your day accordingly.

26
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.810
Which leads us to our next tip,

27
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.900
and that's to tackle your top priorities first.

28
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.800
Resist the urge to knock out a few easy wins

29
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.050
before tackling your most audacious goals for the day.

30
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.300
Instead, do your work in order of priority.

31
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.370
That means starting with your most important

32
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:31.770
tasks of the day,

33
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.880
even if they're also the most daunting

34
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.690
or overwhelming.

35
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.210
The third tip is to group similar tasks

36
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.170
and avoid multitasking.

37
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.190
For example, avoid checking your email every time

38
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.880
you receive a notification.

39
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.790
Instead, schedule a set time each day

40
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.750
that's devoted entirely to checking

41
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.940
and responding to emails.

42
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.890
Or try lumping together several meetings on the same day

43
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.120
or during the same part of the day.

44
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.880
For example, you might limit meeting to Tuesdays

45
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.650
and Thursday afternoons.

46
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.160
Finally, avoid multitasking or task switching.

47
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.310
Instead, work on one task at a time.

48
00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.970
Also group tasks together that require similar skills,

49
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.840
such as tasks that involve editing

50
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.820
or reviewing other's work.

51
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.580
Fourth, is to schedule everything in your work day

52
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.770
using an online calendar.

53
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.640
Schedule work meetings and personal appointments,

54
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.810
as well as buffer time

55
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.310
between those meetings or appointments.

56
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.180
Also, scheduled time

57
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.253
to work on specific projects uninterrupted.

58
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.650
The more you block time out on your calendar,

59
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.010
the easier it will be to protect your time

60
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.890
and distribute it to the projects that matter most.

61
00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.803
Speaking of scheduling everything.

62
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.910
Also use your online calendar

63
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.090
to schedule regular breaks.

64
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.300
Well, it may sound counterintuitive,

65
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.430
taking regular breaks

66
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.300
can actually increase productivity and creativity.

67
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.610
In contrast, working long stretches without breaks,

68
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:00.930
may slow you down

69
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.463
and lead to mental exhaustion over time.

70
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.660
Mental exhaustion can also come in the form of overthinking

71
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.770
or over analyzing your work.

72
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.373
That's where our sixth tip comes in handy.

73
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.700
The sixth tip is to set time limits for yourself.

74
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.440
Determine how long you want to spend on a task

75
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.780
and stick to it.

76
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.930
Set a timer or stopwatch if needed.

77
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.260
Time limits create a sense of urgency

78
00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.000
that can help focus your attention

79
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.710
and cut out distractions.

80
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.950
They can also combat over editing

81
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.130
and analysis paralysis.

82
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.170
Finally, the last tip is to determine your prime time.

83
00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.430
You can do that by answering the following questions.

84
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.130
When do you feel the most motivated

85
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.520
or energized at work?

86
00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.440
When do you do your best work?

87
00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.610
What hours of the day are you most productive?

88
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.510
And are there any times of the day,

89
00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.450
when your energy or motivation levels drop?

90
00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.060
Whether you feel most productive

91
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.930
and energized in the mornings or afternoons,

92
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.630
determine your prime time

93
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.080
and maximize it.

94
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.710
Block or protect your prime time

95
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.790
from routine meetings, emails

96
00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.900
or other low priority tasks.

97
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.480
Instead, schedule your most challenging

98
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.350
and energy consuming projects

99
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.093
when you're feeling your best.

100
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.220
Being busy is not always a good thing.

101
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.960
The real question you should ask yourself is,

102
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.840
am I using my time productively?

103
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.130
Follow these seven time management tips

104
00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.200
to increase your productivity at work

105
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.550
and decrease the amount of time it takes

106
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.443
to accomplish the same goals.
