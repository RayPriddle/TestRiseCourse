00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.740
<v ->It's Monday morning and you arrive at the office</v>

2
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.330
ready to create that report

3
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.450
you've been procrastinating all last week,

4
00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.570
but after logging into your computer,

5
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.970
you see that your inbox is overflowing.

6
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.700
So, you decide to knock out some emails first.

7
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.220
Then, you get pulled into an impromptu meeting

8
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.680
with some coworkers,

9
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.280
and then, you get sucked into an hour-long phone call

10
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.900
with a customer.

11
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.380
Before you know it, it's 2 p.m.

12
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.880
and you haven't even started on your report.

13
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.380
You wonder, where did the day go?

14
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.680
This is one example of what can happen when you don't have

15
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.490
effective time management practices in place.

16
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.770
Effective time management can make or break

17
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.370
your career success,

18
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.993
but what does time management actually mean?

19
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.350
Simply put, time management is the ability to plan

20
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.220
and control how you spend your time to achieve your goals.

21
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.620
Effective time management means you can allocate your time

22
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.563
in a way that aligns with your needs, interests, and values.

23
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.910
Learning how to manage your time effectively

24
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.000
offers several personal and professional advantages.

25
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.980
For example, you can accomplish more

26
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.043
or get more done in less time.

27
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.700
Reduce stress.

28
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.050
There's no need to feel rushed or anxious

29
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.310
about whether or not you'll get your work done

30
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.490
when you're using your time effectively.

31
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.230
Create more free time.

32
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.240
Identifying where to save time

33
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.080
can give you back more free time for self-care, breaks,

34
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.790
or work-life balance.

35
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.120
Finally, effective time management

36
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.110
allows you to live your values.

37
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.060
You can spend more time on the projects, interests,

38
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.313
and people that are most important to you.

39
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.930
In summary, not only can effective time management

40
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.380
help you accomplish more

41
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.610
and be more successful in your work,

42
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.940
but it also can give you more time to spend on the things

43
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.760
that matter most to you outside of work.

44
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.940
So, what's involved in time management

45
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.750
and how can you start managing your time better?

46
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.900
Here are four best practices.

47
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.970
First, one of the easiest ways

48
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.100
you can start managing your time better

49
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.570
is to analyze how you're using it.

50
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.560
Track how you're spending your time

51
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.113
to identify your biggest time stealers throughout the day.

52
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.830
The second best practice is to prioritize.

53
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.000
Which activities are most important to you?

54
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.880
Which tasks are the most valuable to your team

55
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.110
and the company?

56
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.723
And what activities could be eliminated or postponed?

57
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.120
Knowing your priorities is essential

58
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.200
to understanding how to make the best use of your time.

59
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.120
Then, you can set more relevant

60
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.410
and targeted goals for accomplishing them,

61
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.403
which is our third best practice.

62
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.200
Set goals for accomplishing your high-priority items.

63
00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.460
Specific milestones and clear expectations

64
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.203
can provide structure and focus to your day.

65
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.460
Finally, schedule your time using a calendar or planner.

66
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.350
Commit to your goals by blocking out

67
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.490
the necessary time on your calendar

68
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.453
as you would for an important meeting or appointment.

69
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.350
While you can't have more hours in the day,

70
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.060
you can take control over how you spend them.

71
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.000
Follow these four time management best practices

72
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.330
to achieve more, reduce stress,

73
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.203
and regain control of your work and your work-life balance.
