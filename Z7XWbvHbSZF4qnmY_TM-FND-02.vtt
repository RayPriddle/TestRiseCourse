<v ->Are you always late for meetings?</v>

2
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.900
Is your workspace a mess?

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.500
Or are you making more mistakes

4
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.330
or finding it difficult to deliver what you promise at work?

5
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.300
All of these workplace challenges

6
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.300
may be symptoms of a common source, poor time management.

7
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.540
How we manage or fail to manage our time

8
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.960
can have surprising repercussions on our work and wellbeing.

9
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.030
It's possible that you have a time management problem

10
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.180
and don't even know it.

11
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.500
So, let's reveal four of the most commonly

12
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.510
overlooked symptoms of poor time management,

13
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.620
because you have to be aware of a problem

14
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.903
before you can fix it.

15
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.670
The first symptom of poor time management

16
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.900
is that you're always late.

17
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.400
You're the person who always arrives at the meeting last,

18
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.270
misses appointments altogether,

19
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.250
or rushes from one task or engagement to the next.

20
00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.960
Struggles with punctuality

21
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.340
are often a sign of poor scheduling, poor time estimation,

22
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.590
or a failure to think ahead.

23
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.140
For example, you might be underestimating

24
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.820
how long it takes you to complete a task,

25
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.230
or you might be failing to predict traffic

26
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.693
or project delays.

27
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.410
If this sounds like you,

28
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.470
then one tip is to add a buffer.

29
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.020
Schedule an extra 10 minutes between meetings

30
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.060
in case those appointments run longer than expected

31
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.600
or add an extra hour or half day

32
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.053
when estimating how long it will take to complete a project.

33
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.500
The second symptom of poor time management

34
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.610
is a messy workspace.

35
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.090
Is your desk cluttered with illegible sticky notes

36
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.020
and stale coffee cups?

37
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.940
Is your organization system lacking or nonexistent?

38
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.270
If your workspace looks like a tornado just passed through,

39
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.550
then you might've fallen prey to procrastination,

40
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.050
or perhaps you simply don't make workspace organization

41
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.870
a priority in your busy schedule.

42
00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.440
But did you know that a cluttered workspace

43
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.640
can create a cluttered mind?

44
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.190
A messy work environment may unwittingly

45
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.853
become a source of distraction and stress.

46
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.490
So, get motivated and stop procrastinating

47
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.310
by reminding yourself that a tidy

48
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.723
and organized work environment is a worthwhile investment.

49
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.660
The third symptom is breaking

50
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.780
or neglecting your commitments.

51
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.140
This describes when you fail to deliver what you promised

52
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.800
or do what you said you were going to do.

53
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.170
Breaking or neglecting commitments may be a sign

54
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.460
that you're over committing yourself.

55
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.300
This can happen when you fail to delegate,

56
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.610
communicate your workload with your boss,

57
00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.123
or ask your boss about priorities.

58
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.580
One tip for addressing this symptom

59
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.830
is to stop making commitments that you can't keep.

60
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.890
Communicate when you're at capacity

61
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.793
and ask for help when you need it.

62
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.900
Finally, the last often overlooked symptom

63
00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.520
of poor time management is poor performance.

64
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.400
You may become less efficient,

65
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.160
which describes when you aren't working

66
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.270
as fast as you could, or you may become less effective,

67
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.500
which describes when you're making more mistakes than usual,

68
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.620
or your quality of work declines.

69
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.530
Poor performance can be a sign

70
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.980
that you're getting distracted

71
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.003
or trying to do too many tasks at the same time.

72
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.730
If this sounds like you,

73
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.370
then one tip is to stop multitasking.

74
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.020
If you're working on a project,

75
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.220
don't check your emails at the same time.

76
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.033
Focus on one task at a time and eliminate interruptions.

77
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.650
Now, put it all together and ask yourself,

78
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.230
am I often late or rushing?

79
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.140
Do I have a cluttered or disorganized workspace?

80
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.403
Am I known to break or neglect my commitments?

81
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.453
And has my work performance declined recently?

82
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.160
If you answered yes to one or more of these questions,

83
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.740
then you may be struggling to manage your time effectively.

84
00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.400
The good news is this.

85
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.060
Now that you know what the root of the problem is,

86
00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.290
you can fix it.

87
00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.690
Start evaluating how you manage your time

88
00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.900
and look for opportunities to address

89
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.830
and alleviate the symptoms you're experiencing.

90
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.040
Remember that awareness is the first step to action.

91
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.120
By recognizing the symptoms of poor time management,

92
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.043
you're on your way to improving it.
