<v ->Are you using your time effectively at work?</v>

2
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.370
If you answered yes to this question, then how do you know?

3
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.160
Most of us have some aspect of our workday

4
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.210
that could be streamlined or used more productively.

5
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.620
We just may not be aware of it.

6
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.740
Time-tracking is one way to gain awareness.

7
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.600
You can learn where your time is going

8
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.490
and identify opportunities to improve your time management.

9
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.340
So, here's how to track your time

10
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.830
and make sure you're spending it in ways that align

11
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.993
with your goals and values.

12
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.460
As we get started, you may be wondering,

13
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.670
why should I track my time?

14
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.480
There are two main goals and benefits of time-tracking.

15
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.550
First, time-tracking gives you a more accurate understanding

16
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.490
of where your time is going.

17
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.330
How much time are you devoting

18
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.930
to competing projects and priorities?

19
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.840
Time-tracking can help you find out.

20
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.470
And second, time-tracking allows you to analyze

21
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.440
how you're spending your time.

22
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.310
Once you have reliable data on your time use,

23
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.250
you can then ask bigger questions such as,

24
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.993
where could I save or reallocate my time?

25
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.430
Tracking how you spend your time is similar

26
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.640
to tracking how you spend your money.

27
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.120
You have to understand your major expenses

28
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.420
and spending habits before you can learn

29
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.470
how to budget effectively.

30
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.180
Likewise, you must understand your time spending habits

31
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.130
before you can learn how to budget your time effectively.

32
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.593
So, how can you start time-tracking?

33
00:01:34.593 --> 00:01:38.790
There are four main steps involved in tracking your time.

34
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.870
First, choose a time-tracking tool.

35
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.900
For example, you might use a spreadsheet,

36
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.530
create a simple list using a Word document or notebook

37
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.113
or research and select a time tracking app.

38
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.010
A time-tracking tool can be anything that allows you

39
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.600
to record how long you spend on daily activities.

40
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.560
Choose the tool that's easiest and most convenient

41
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.563
for you to use.

42
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.000
The second step is to categorize your activities.

43
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.050
In other words,

44
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.900
how might you group your daily individual tasks

45
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.590
into broader themes?

46
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.780
For example, you might create categories based

47
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.960
on your core job responsibilities or projects,

48
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.650
or you might also create categories

49
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.813
for common tasks like emails or meetings.

50
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.290
Remember that the goal of categorizing your activities is

51
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.810
to find bigger themes.

52
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.910
It's easier to analyze how you spend your time on a handful

53
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.105
of broad categories than it is on hundreds

54
00:02:36.105 --> 00:02:37.943
of individual tasks.

55
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.530
The third step is to get started.

56
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.870
Track your time for a week or longer.

57
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.400
Make a daily habit of recording your activities

58
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.400
and how long you spend on them.

59
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.040
Track your time as you go,

60
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.300
don't wait until the end of the day.

61
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.560
For example, your notes might read, email 30 minutes,

62
00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.863
meeting one hour or weekly blog post, four hours.

63
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.030
If you can, track your time for two weeks, three weeks

64
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.410
or even a month.

65
00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.270
Your data will be more accurate over

66
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.023
a long time-tracking period.

67
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.660
Finally, the last step is to tally the results by category.

68
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.080
How long did you spend on each category

69
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.410
throughout your time-tracking period?

70
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.340
And what percentage of the work week are you spending

71
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.170
on each category?

72
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.990
For example, you might calculate

73
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.970
that you're spending two hours a week

74
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.060
on personal internet use.

75
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.240
If you're working a 40 hour work week,

76
00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.863
that's 5% of your total time.

77
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.440
At this point, you've finished tracking your time

78
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.860
and the results are in.

79
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.510
But now, what do you do with those results

80
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.323
to make meaningful time management changes?

81
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.500
The answer is to analyze your findings.

82
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.750
Evaluate how you're distributing your time

83
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.490
across categories.

84
00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.310
Take note of where you're spending the most time

85
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.977
and ask yourself questions such as,

86
00:04:02.977 --> 00:04:05.630
is this a good use of my time?

87
00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.890
Identify activities that could be cut or delegated.

88
00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.630
Where could I save time?

89
00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.470
Identify activities that could be streamlined, reduced,

90
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.910
or moved down your priority list.

91
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.300
And finally, where do I wanna spend more time?

92
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.880
Consider how you might reallocate your hours

93
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.223
to high value or high priority activities.

94
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.620
In summary, time-tracking is twofold.

95
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.360
First, record how you're spending your time

96
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.400
to get more reliable data.

97
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.600
Second, analyze the results to determine

98
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.280
where you could save or reallocate your time

99
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.480
to better support your goals and values.

100
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.410
By following these practices, you'll gain awareness

101
00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.710
of your time spending habits and identify opportunities

102
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.543
to make smarter and more informed time management decisions.
